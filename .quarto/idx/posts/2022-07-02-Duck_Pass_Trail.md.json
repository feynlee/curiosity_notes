If you intend to return through the Emerald Lake Trail, you can also park at the nearby parking lot by the Emerald Lake Trailhead.\n\n**Fee**:\nThis trail is free for day-hike. However, you need a backcountry permit if you plan on staying overnight.\n\n**Restrooms**:\nThere are restrooms at the trailhead parking lot but not on the trail.\n\n**Distance**:\n9.5-mile R.T.\n\n**Elevation**:\n9,128 feet to 10,800 feet\n\n**Weather**:\nSunny day ( 61 F ~ 72 F for my hike ). It was a bit chilly in the morning when I started at 8:30 am, but it quickly warmed up. Plus the strenuous climb, I don't think a jacket is needed at this time of year from my personal experience. It even got a bit hot near noon when I was under constant sunlight climbing to Duck Lake.\n\n# Things to Pack\n\n- 3 liters of water\n\n  I actually packed two 2 gallons of water, and quickly regretted it due to the heavy weight. So I poured out 1 gallon, and didn't even finish the other gallon by the end of the hike, despite constant hydration. 3 liters of water would've been enough for me.\n\n- Battery Pack\n\n  If you plan to take lots of photos and videos (you should), you will definitely need a battery pack to recharge your phone.\n\n- Sunglasses\n\n- Lunch\n\n  I packed some energy bars and some beef jerky. You can find some great spots at Duck Lake to enjoy your lunch before heading back.\n\n- Sunscreen\n\n  You will need this. Don't forget to reapply every 2~3 hours.\n\n\n- Download the offline google map for this area!\n\n  You won't have any cellphone signals during the hike. Having a map on your phone with your GPS on would help you know how far along you are in the hike.\n\n**Things I didn't pack but could be helpful**\n\n- *Mosquito Repellent*\n\n  I didn't pack this, and was a bit regretting it. There were lots of mosquitos especially near the lakes. You may not want to add that to the weight. In that case, I would say at least remember to apply some mosquito repellent before heading out.\n\n- *Hiking sticks*\n\n  I didn't use hiking sticks, but I can see how that would be of great help to people, especially on the strenuous climb to the Duck Lake, and if you are heading back through the Emerald Lake Trail, which is very steep."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"2022-07-02-Duck_Pass_Trail.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"aliases":["/Travel/2022/07/02/Duck_Pass_Trail"],"author":"Ziyue Li","categories":["Travel"],"date":"2022-07-02","description":"Hopefully everything you need for planning this beautiful hike.","hide":false,"image":"images/posts/2022/duck_lake-3.JPG","layout":"post","search_exclude":false,"tags":["Hiking"],"title":"Everything You Need to Know About Hiking the Duck Pass Trail"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
