## Step 1: Display Grid
First, we change the display to be "grid":

```css
div.container {
    display: grid;
}
```

## Step 2: Define Grid

We then define the grid using "fr" (short for fraction) as the following:

```scss
div.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 5fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/css_grid.png" width="60%">

Think of each fraction as 1 unit. So the above code defines a grid with 3 columns with width 5, 1, 1 respectively and two rows with equal height. One can also define the grid using px, percentages and other units, but I find "fr" to be very convenient.

## Step 3: Place Content Into the Grid
The easiest way is to use grid-template-areas:

```scss
div.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 5fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-areas:
        "description social rss"
        "description social rss";
}

div.description {
    grid-area: description;
    justify-self: stretch;
    align-self: stretch;
}
div.social {
    grid-area: social;
    justify-self: stretch;
    align-self: stretch;
}
div.rss {
    grid-area: rss;
    justify-self: stretch;
    align-self: stretch;
}
```

We assign the **grid-area** attribute for each block that we want to place into the grid, and then use **grid-template-areas** to easily specify how they should be layed out within the grid. The **justify-self** and **align-self** attributes further specifies how they should be justified and aligned within their grid space.

That should get you started! It's really that simple!
